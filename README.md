###

**Endia** is a dynamic Array library for Scientific Computing, similar to PyTorch, Numpy and JAX. It offers:

- **Automatic differentiation**: Compute derivatives of arbitrary order.
- **Complex number support:** Use Endia for advanced scientific applications.
- **Dual API:** Choose between a PyTorch-like imperative or a JAX-like functional interface.
- **JIT Compilation:** Leverage MAX to speed up training and inference.

## Installation

1. **Install [Mojo and MAX](https://docs.modular.com/max/install)** üî• (v24.4)

   Optional but recommended: Install the [nightly version of Mojo](https://docs.modular.com/max/install#install-nightly-builds) to access Endia's most up-to-date features, such as the FFT module.

   > Note: To use these cutting-edge features, you'll need to switch to Endia's nightly branch (see step 2).


2. **Clone the repository**: Choose one of the following options to clone the repository:


    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/endia-org/Endia.git
    cd Endia
    ```

    If you aim to use the nightly (development) version, switch to the `nightly` branch:

    ```bash
    git checkout nightly
    ```

3. **Set Up Environment**:

    ```bash
    chmod +x setup.sh
    ./setup.sh
    ```

    Required dependencies: `torch`, `numpy`, `graphviz`. These will be installed automatically by the setup script.

## A tiny example

In this guide, we'll demonstrate how to compute the **value**, **gradient**, and the **Hessian** (i.e. the second-order derivative) of a simple function. First by using Endia's Pytorch-like API and then by using a more Jax-like functional API. In both examples, we initially define a function **foo** that takes an array and returns the sum of the squares of its elements.

### The **Pytorch** way

When using Endia's imperative (PyTorch-like) interface, we compute the gradient of a function by calling the **backward** method on the function's output. This imperative style requires explicit management of the computational graph, including setting `requires_grad=True` for the input arrays (i.e. leaf nodes) and using `create_graph=True` in the backward method when computing higher-order derivatives.

```python
from endia import Tensor, sum, arange
import endia.autograd.functional as F


# Define the function
def foo(x: Tensor) -> Tensor:
    return sum(x ** 2)

def main():
    # Initialize variable - requires_grad=True needed!
    x = arange(1.0, 4.0, requires_grad=True) # [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]

    # Compute result, first and second order derivatives
    y = foo(x)
    y.backward(create_graph=True)            
    dy_dx = x.grad()
    d2y_dx2 = F.grad(outs=sum(dy_dx), inputs=x)[0]

    # Print results
    print(y)        # 14.0
    print(dy_dx)    # [2.0, 4.0, 6.0]
    print(d2y_dx2)  # [2.0, 2.0, 2.0]
```

### The **JAX** way

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->

    <img src="assets/jax_logo.png" alt="Endia Logo" width="65">
  </a>
</p>

When using Endia's functional (JAX-like) interface, the computational graph is handled implicitly. By calling the `grad` or `jacobian` function on foo, we create a `Callable` which computes the full Jacobian matrix. This `Callable` can be passed to the `grad` or `jacobian` function again to compute higher-order derivatives.

```python
from endia import grad, jacobian
from endia.numpy import sum, arange, ndarray


def foo(x: ndarray) -> ndarray:
    return sum(x**2)


def main():
    # create Callables for the first and second order derivatives
    foo_jac = grad(foo)
    foo_hes = jacobian(foo_jac)

    x = arange(1.0, 4.0)       # [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]

    print(foo(x))              # 14.0
    print(foo_jac(x)[ndarray]) # [2.0, 4.0, 6.0]
    print(foo_hes(x)[ndarray]) # [[2.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 2.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 2.0]]
```

*And there is so much more! Endia can handle complex valued functions, can perform both forward and reverse-mode automatic differentiation, it even has a builtin JIT compiler to make things go brrr. Explore the full **list of features** in the [documentation](https://endia.org).*

## Why another ML framework?

- üß† **Advance AI & Scientific Computing:** Push boundaries with clear and understandable algorithms
- üöÄ **Mojo-Powered Clarity:** High-performance open-source code that remains readable and pythonic through and through
- üìê **Explainability:** Prioritize clarity and educational value over exhaustive features
