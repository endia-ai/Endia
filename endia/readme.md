# The Endia Core Library 

The Endia Core Library is a collection of functions that are used to perform mathematical operations on Arrays. The functions defined here are small building blocks that can be combined to create more complex operations. Almost all them are differentiable (forward and reverse mode autodiff) and also work on complex valued arrays.
